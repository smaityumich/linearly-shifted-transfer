# Codes for ``A linear adjustment based approach to posterior drift in transfer learning`` paper

In this repository we provide the codes for the experiments with linearly shifted transfer learning model both for synthetic and UK Bio-bank data. The codes for sythetic experiments are provided in `sim` folder and the codes for UK Biobank data experiments are provided in the `UKBB` folder. A demonstartion of the linearly adjusted transfer learning method can be found in the `demo.R` file in `sim` folder.
