### Synthetic experiments 

The codes for experiments with our linearly adjusted transfer learning model on synthetically generated data are presented here. Please run the function `iteraction.single` in `demo.R` source file for an illustration of our linearly adjusted transfer learning method on a simulated data. The full set of experiments are given the files `transfer.R` and `slurm.sh`, and the summaries of the provided in the folder `summary`. You can the `plot.ipynb` notebook to recreate the plots, which can also be found in the folder `plot`.
